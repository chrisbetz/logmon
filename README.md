# logmon

A complete logging/monitoring setup based upon Riemann, an Elasticsearch Cluster, ElasticHQ, Kibana and/or Grafana.

# Aim of this project

Aim of this project is to bring together the different parts necessary to build a complete logging/monitoring pipeline. For me, that's everything from gathering information to processing it (using Riemann), storing it (using an Elasticsearch cluster), and makeing it available (using Kibana and/or Grafana.)

It surely isn't as complete as commercial-grade projects, but it's a good starting point besides all those tutorials you need to wire together yourself.
